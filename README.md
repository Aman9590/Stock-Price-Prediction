# Stock-Price-Prediction

📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques based on historical market data. The goal is to analyze past stock trends and build a predictive model that can estimate future price movements.

🔧 Project Workflow

Data Collection & Preprocessing
Historical stock price data is loaded and cleaned. Relevant features such as opening price, closing price, high, low, and volume are selected and normalized for better model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations are used to understand trends, patterns, and relationships in stock price movements over time.

Model Building
A machine learning model (such as Linear Regression / LSTM / other time-series model) is trained to learn patterns from historical data and forecast future prices.

Prediction & Evaluation
The model predicts stock prices, and performance is evaluated using error metrics and visual comparison between actual and predicted values.
